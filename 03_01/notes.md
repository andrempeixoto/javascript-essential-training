# Objects: A practical introduction (by Morten Rand-Hendriksen)
***

## *Objects*:

#### 1. are based on **prototypes**  
**an object is a unique instance of an object prototype**
(i.e.: backpack)

#### 2. have a set of **properties**
(i.e.: pockets, straps, lid)

#### 3. can have features, called **methods**, that allow us to change their existing set of properties 
methods: property-changing features inside objects
**these methods act on the current object only**
(i.e.: lids can be open and closed, as well as pockets and zippers; straps can have their length adjusted)

Objects can be placed inside other objects, (i.e.: a flashlight inside the backpack), and they have their own set of properties and methods.

When placed inside an **object**, *these other objects* - along with their properties and methods - are considered as *properties of this object* for as long as they are inside it.
