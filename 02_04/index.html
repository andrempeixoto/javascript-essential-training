<!-- Working with modules, backpack.js's content is imported into script.js, so it's content isn't accessible via the page context, but only within the context in which it is imported into: script.js. -->

<!-- When does the browser execute JavaScript?
  By default: When the script is encountered. 
  If the script is set to "async", when the script is fully loaded. 
    -> <script src="javascript.js" async></script>
  If the script is set to "defer", when the entire HTML page is rendered.
    -> <script src="javascript.js" defer></script>
** When using the type="module", it is automatically loaded as if set to "defer"

What happens when you defer JavaScript?
  The browser loads the JavaScript asynchronously when it is encountered, then waits until all HTML is rendered before executing the script.

JavaScript modules are heavily used in frameworks like React and Vue. What is the advantage of using modules?
  Modules enable modularization of code where individual functions, components, data objects, and other parts can be separated into individual files.
